[Kolibri Studio](https://studio.learningequality.org) is a web application designed to deliver educational materials to [Kolibri](http://learningequality.org/kolibri/). It supports:

- Organizing and publishing content channels in the format suitable for import from Kolibri
- Curating content and remixing of existing channels into custom channels aligned to various educational standards, country curricula, and special needs
- Creating learning pathways and assessments
- Uploading new content through the web interface or programatically using [ricecooker-powered](https://github.com/learningequality/ricecooker) content import scripts

Kolibri Studio uses the [Django framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/) for the backend and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for the frontend.

If you are looking for help setting up custom content channels, uploading and organizing resources using Kolibri Studio, please refer to the [User Guide](https://kolibri-studio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
