Kolibri Content Channels
########################

The main purpose of Kolibri Studio is to allow you to build learning *packages* called **content channels** according to your needs. You can build content channels by uploading your own learning resources (exercises, videos, audio or document files), or by importing them from publicly available content channels.

A Kolibri **content channel** is a collection of educational resources (exercises, videos, audio or document files) and associated metadata, prepared and organized for their use in Kolibri. 

Kolibri content channels can be public or private/unlisted.

Public Content Channels
=======================

Kolibri application can serve content from several publicly available content channels, which administrators may choose to import and use on devices in their facilities.

You can access Kolibri public content channels the Kolibri Studio website, in order to view and import content from them, but you cannot edit them. You can, however, offer to contribute by translating/localizing, adding voice-over, and reporting issues. Contact the LE team for further guidance regarding contributions on public channels.

Learning Equality team performs regular updates of the publicly available content channels on the Kolibri Studio site, to keep them aligned when the original content sources change. Channels imported into Kolibri will display a notification when the updated content is available, but the administrators at the local Kolibri installation will evaluate the most appropriate update timeframes according to each deployment needs.

To use a publicly available Kolibri content channel, all you need to know is the **Channel ID/token** in order to import it into the local Kolibri installation. Find the :ref:`channel ID/token above the name of the channel in Kolibri Studio <share_channels>`.

Private/Unlisted Content Channels
=================================

**Kolibri Studio** provides the tools to build and curate your own custom content channels. As a content curator you can use parts of content from public channels and combine it with your own imported content to build custom content channels, aligned to the local curricula, or according to your specific learning needs.

Who will use Kolibri Studio to curate content channels will depend on the setting in which Kolibri is deployed. Content curation tasks may be the responsibility of the same person who installed Kolibri, or require different and separate roles.

In case of your private/unlisted channels, only users who receive the channel ID/token can view and use the channel.
