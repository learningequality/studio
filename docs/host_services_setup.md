# Local development instructions: run everything on your host machine

This guide will walk through setting up Kolibri Studio for local development, where you'll run Studio's Python apps and all of Studio's services on your host machine, without the need for docker.

## Prerequisites
For detailed instructions on installing and configuring Volta, pyenv, and pyenv-virtualenv, please see the [Prerequisites](./local_dev_host.md#prerequisites) section in our Local Development with host guide.

## Install system dependencies and services
Studio requires some background services to be running:

* Minio - a local S3 storage emulation
* PostgreSQL - a relational database
* Redis - a fast key/value store useful for caching

### Ubuntu or Debian
```bash
# Install packages
sudo apt-get install -y python-tk \
    postgresql-server-dev-all postgresql-contrib postgresql-client postgresql-16 \
    ffmpeg libmagickwand-dev redis-server wkhtmltopdf

# Install minio
wget https://dl.minio.io/server/minio/release/linux-amd64/minio -O bin/minio
sudo chmod +x bin/minio
```

### Mac OS
```bash
brew install postgresql@16 redis ffmpeg imagemagick@6 gs
# note, this version of minio may not be compatible with Studio
brew install minio/stable/minio
brew link --force postgresql@16
brew link --force imagemagick@6
```

### Windows

**Note:** Windows is no longer supported due to incompatibilities with some required packages. If you are developing on Windows, it is recommended to use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Please follow the [WSL setup guide](./local_dev_wsl.md) for detailed instructions.

## Set up the database

Make sure postgres is running:

```bash
service postgresql start
# alternatively: pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgresql@16 start
```

Start the client with:

```bash
sudo su postgres  # switch to the postgres account
psql  # mac: psql postgres
```

Create a database user with username `learningequality` and password `kolibri`:

```sql
CREATE USER learningequality with NOSUPERUSER INHERIT NOCREATEROLE CREATEDB LOGIN NOREPLICATION NOBYPASSRLS PASSWORD 'kolibri';
  ```

Create a database called `kolibri-studio`:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE "kolibri-studio" WITH TEMPLATE = template0 ENCODING = "UTF8" OWNER = "learningequality";
```

Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> to exit the `psql` client. Finally

```bash
exit  # leave the postgres account
```

## Build your python virtual environment
For complete instructions on installing Python 3.10.13, creating and activating the virtual environment, and installing Studioâ€™s Python dependencies, please refer to the [Build Your Python Virtual Environment](./local_dev_host.md#build-your-python-virtual-environment) section in our Local Development with host guide.

### A note about `psycopg2`
The packages `postgresql-16`, `postgresql-contrib`, and `postgresql-server-dev-all` are required to build `psycopg2` python driver.

### A note about dependencies on Apple Silicon M1+
If you run into an error with `pip install` related to the `grcpio` package, it is because it currently [does not support M1 with the version for `grcpio` Studio uses](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/25082). In order to fix it, you will need to add the following environmental variables before running `pip install`:
```bash
export GRPC_PYTHON_BUILD_SYSTEM_OPENSSL=1
export GRPC_PYTHON_BUILD_SYSTEM_ZLIB=1
export CFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl/include"
export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl/lib"
```

## Install frontend dependencies
For guidance on installing Node 20.X, pnpm, and all required frontend dependencies, running the services, initializing Studio, and running the development server , please refer to the [Install Frontend Dependencies](./local_dev_host.md#install-frontend-dependencies) section in our Local Development with host guide.

Either of the above commands will take a few minutes to build the frontend. When it's done, you can sign in with the account created by the `pnpm run devsetup` command:
- url: `http://localhost:8080/accounts/login/`
- username: `a@a.com`
- password: `a`
