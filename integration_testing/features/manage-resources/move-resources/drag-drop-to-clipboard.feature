Feature: Drag-drop to clipboard

	Background:
		Given I am signed in to Studio
			And I am on the channel editor view

	Scenario: Drag-drop resources to an open clipboard
		When I click on clipboard button on the bottom-right of the screen
		Then the clipboard opens up
		When the clipboard is open
			And I begin to drag resources from the channel editor into the open clipboard
		Then I see the clipboard shows a thick border and turns opaque to indicate this is a draggable area
		When I drop the resource into the clipboard
		Then the opaque area disappears
			And I see the clipboard updated to reflect the newly dragged resources

	Scenario: Drag-drop resources to the clipboard button
		When the clipboard is closed and the interface shows the clipboard button
			And I begin to drag resources from the channel editor toward the clipboard button
		Then I see the clipboard button changes color styling and move slightly up and down
		When I drop the content into the clipboard button
		Then the clipboard button styling gets back to normal
			And I see a snackbar appears to confirm the resources were moved to clipboard
