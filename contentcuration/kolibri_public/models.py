    This is added as insurance against concurrency issues. It seems far less likely than for our
    regular channel tree_ids, but is here as a safety.

    Because MPTT uses plain integers for tree IDs and does not use an auto-incrementing field for them,
    the same ID can sometimes be assigned to two trees if two channel create ops happen concurrently.

    As we are using this table only for the ID generation, it does not need any fields.

    We resolve this by creating a dummy table and using its ID as the tree index to take advantage of the db's
    concurrency-friendly way of generating sequential integer IDs. There is a custom migration that ensures
    that the number of records (and thus id) matches the max tree ID number when this table gets added.
