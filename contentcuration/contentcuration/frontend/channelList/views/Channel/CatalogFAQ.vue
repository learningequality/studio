      descriptionP2:
        'Click on a channel to get a preview of what subjects and topics it covers, learn more about its creator, see how many resources the channel contains, and learn how to import it into Kolibri. You can also find coach-specific content (lesson plans, teacher professional guides, and other supplementary facilitation material), assessments and exercises, and captions for accessibility.',

      aboutLibraryHeader: 'About the Kolibri Content Library',
      selectionQuestion: 'How does Learning Equality determine what goes into this library?',
      selectionAnswerP1:
        'Our approach is unique in that we aim to assemble a library of resources which supports the diversity of needs Kolibri is designed to meet, rather than collecting all possible open educational resources.',
      selectionAnswerP2:
        'To inform what we select, the Learning Equality team is continually maintaining our awareness of openly licensed digital resources available in the educational landscape. Most of our resources come from an organization, institution, or creator with learning design experience and an educational mandate. We prioritize providing a diversity of grade levels, subject areas and languages. Where possible, we also evaluate and seek input on the degree to which the materials may be suitable for the unique blended learning settings in which we work.',

      maintenanceQuestion: 'How is this library created and maintained?',
      maintenanceAnswerP1:
        'Because Kolibri is designed for learners and educators who are disconnected from the internet, content must first be packaged so that it can be used without internet connection. For most sources, our content team uses custom-written, automated scripts to bring content into Kolibri from a website, an app, or a private source such as a hard drive (with the appropriate permissions).',

      endorsementAnswer:
        'We select sources with an educational affiliation or mandate, so you can trust that most resources in the Kolibri Content Library were designed for learning purposes. However,  we are not able to guarantee the appropriateness of each individual item within any particular source. We recommend that educators and administrators conduct a thorough review of any digital content using their own criteria - including reorganization and re-curation, if necessary - before using it with learners. Since we recognize that there may be many different standards across situations for criteria like preferred levels of interactivity, subject/age appropriateness, cultural sensitivity and tone, among others, we have intentionally offered a wide range of materials to help meet the needs of all learners whatever they may be.',

      ownershipQuestion: 'Does Learning Equality own these resources?',
      ownershipAnswer:
        'No. Just like an online learning repository with links to external websites, we gather useful digital learning resources to help our community discover a rich variety of learning materials they may not have known about otherwise. All the materials in this educational library are fully credited to the creating organization, reformatted for best display on digital devices, and include any additional information the creator has shared with us. We only include content which is either openly licensed, available to distribute for special nonprofit or noncommercial purposes, or shared with us for distribution through agreement with the creator. Since materials in the library are intended for use in an open source platform, we do not profit financially from their use.',

      newContentQuestion: 'Does Learning Equality add new materials?',

      channelQuestion: 'What is a channel?',
      channelAnswer:
        "A channel is Kolibri’s unit of organization for digital content. It's a collection of resources organized by single institutions or creators, each of which may contain a set of books, games, textbooks, articles, simulations, exercises, and many more types of educational materials, all made available for use in Kolibri without the need for internet access. A channel isn't necessarily a course or a sequence, it's simply a collection of materials published or gathered together by one organization, as close to the provider's original layout as possible, while still organized for the best possible navigation in Kolibri.",

      coachContentAnswer:
        'Most resources are directed at learners, but some, such as lesson plans, subject refreshers, professional learning guides, and similar, are directed at teachers and facilitators. In Kolibri, we mark this content as "for coaches" and limit its visibility to those with coach accounts.
